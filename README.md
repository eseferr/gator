This is a guided Gator project from Boot.dev

This is an RSS feed aggregator called "Gator" in go it's a CLI tool that allows users to:

    Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
    Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
    Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
    View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

Project Description:
In this guided project you'll practice building a CLI in Go, and you'll use production-ready database tools like PostgreSQL, SQLc, Goose, and psql. This won't just be another CLI utility, but a service that has a long-running service worker that reaches out over the internet to fetch data from remote locations.
